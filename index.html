    <p>When I was a kid Metallica was a pretty big deal. Over the years, their 
        popularity has increased but many early fans have abandoned them as their 
        relevance has waned. The napster debacle didn't help much, but what's worse is 
        the album Fuel. Here are some reasons it sucked</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>The song titled "Fuel"</li>
            <li>"eeeyyeeaahhss"</li>
            <li>Lars Ulrich's constant reminders people need to pay for their music</li>
